This project, the computational identification of the number and type of AT domains in a random PKS amino acid sequence, was completed by Neil Klenk, Kyoung Won Oe, and Lee Sugarek.

Included in this repository should be all relevant project material including presentation, report, and code including the makefile. All relevant pictures are included in the report.

To compile the program use "make" command. Different fasta files can be attempted by switching out the current "fasta.txt" file with another of the same name.

Any fasta file of comparable length should work fine, but those significantly longer than the test case aren't guranteed.

Different matrices may also be attempted by switching out the current "matrix.txt" for another of the same name and dimensions.
The current matrix can be found at: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Class/FieldGuide/BLOSUM62.txt
