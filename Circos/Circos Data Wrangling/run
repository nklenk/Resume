# This runfile takes the karyotype created by rn6_karyotype_gen.py, and creates link data

# This is meant to be run in the circos-tools-0.22/tools folder after file "data"
# has been created, and Rn6.karyotype.txt has been added to that


# Creating random link data
cat data/Rn6.karyotype.txt | randomlinks/bin/randomlinks > data/Rn6.links.txt

# Binning link data for scatterplots etc
cat data/Rn6.karyotype.txt | randomlinks/bin/randomlinks | binlinks/bin/binlinks > data/Rn6.binned.links.txt

# Bundling link data for ribbon creation
cat data/Rn6.karyotype.txt | randomlinks/bin/randomlinks | bundlelinks/bin/bundlelinks > data/Rn6.bundled.links.txt
