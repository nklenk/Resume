# Resume
### A showcase of past code that I have written sepparated into folders as follows

## Python Data Analysis
### Some projects that I have worked on since graduating. Includes data cleaning, data visualization, and some machine learning as well

## Bioinformatics (R Data Analysis)
### 3 projects that I completed as part of a Bioinfomratics course at UT Austin. Each project includes code in R as well as analysis of the data. These projects are focused on data analysis, not restriced to biological data.

## OpenMP (in C)
### A few assignments that I did in my Parallel Computing course at UT Austin. Majority of the code is timing different parallelization methodes followed by analysis of those times. All of this was run on the Stampede super computer owned by the Institute of Computational Engineering and Science (ICES).

## Scientific and Technical Computing (in C)
### A few assignments that I did in my Scientific and Technical Computing course at UT Austin. Includes convergence methods, matrix multiplication, Monte Carlo simulations, as well as the report to the final project. All of this was run on the Stampede super computer owned by the Institute of Computational Engineering and Science (ICES).

## Circos
$6 rat genome. Created using the Circos data visualization tool (Circos.ca)

## Bayesian Statistics Report
### A brief report that I wrote on Bayesian statistics, the fallacies of the P-value, and proposed a solution using Bayesian statistics
